<p>Django is a <del>free and open-source web application</del> framework written <strike>in Python that follows the model-template-views </strike>strike>(MTV) architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established in the US as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.0 Django is a collection of modules that make development easier, allowing users to create applications or websites from an existing source instead of from scratch.1</p>
<p1>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that allows developers to build web applications without worrying about low-level details such as protocol and thread management.2 It was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004. Flask is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.0 Flask provides tools, libraries, and technologies that allow developers to build web applications, including web pages, blogs, wikis, web-based calendar applications, and commercial websites.1</p1>
